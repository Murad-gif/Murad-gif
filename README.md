# 💫 About Me:
🛠️ I’m currently working on: Developing an AI-driven full-stack sign language learning platform called Sign Quest. This project utilizes technologies like React.js, Python, Spring Boot, MySQL, and advanced deep learning models.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on: Innovative educational technology projects, particularly those that integrate AI and machine learning to enhance learning experiences.<br><br>🆘 I’m looking for help with: Expanding my knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and implementing them in real-world applications.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced machine learning models and AI frameworks, focusing on their application in real-time gesture recognition and personalized learning systems.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: My experience in developing full-stack applications, especially using React, Python, and Spring Boot. Also, ask me about creating AI chatbots and using deep learning for gesture recognition.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I created a custom dataset of over 10,000 images using OpenCV for training deep learning models. This was part of my project to provide real-time feedback for sign language learners.<br><br>
